# Advanced-Math
A simple plugin for the Godot game engine which implements additional mathematical operations.

## Installation

Download either the repository or the "addons.zip" file from the releases and take only the "addons" folder. 
If your Godot project doesn't have an "addons" directory in the project root folder, just put the whole addons folder inside the root directory. If you have one already in there just put the "advanced_math" folder inside the "addons" folder in your pre-existing addons folder in your project root. 
Then you only need to enable the plugin inside the Godot editor via "Project" -> "Project Settings..." -> "Plugins". In there you have a list of your installed plugins. There set the status of "Advanced Math" to "enabled" by ticking the check box.
